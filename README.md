# Calendar Maker

This is a simple, interactive Python script for generating monthly calendars in text format. Users can input a specific year and month, and the script will produce a calendar for that period, which is then saved to a text file.

## Features

- Interactive year and month selection.
- Generates a full month calendar including correct alignment for days of the week.
- Outputs the calendar to a console view and saves it as a text file named `calendar_YEAR_MONTH.txt`.
- Improved formatting for easier reading of the calendar days and weeks.

## Improvements

This script is an enhanced version of the calendar project found in "Make Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart. Improvements include:

- Better handling of user input, ensuring robust year and month validation.
- Enhanced output formatting, with clearer separation of weeks and a more aesthetic overall appearance.
- Added comments and documentation for better understanding and maintainability of the code.
